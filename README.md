# RAW

RAW (Readers and Writers) is a social platform for both readers and writers. It is a special 
place where fans can connect with the favorite authors more easily, receive alerts for new 
releases for their favorite series, and even buy books in various formats.

## The Idea
- Three kinds of writer categories: Content creator, Nonfictional, or fictional.
- Writers will be verified as either Published or Unpublished/Self-Publishing.
- Mutual platforms. A user can see how they are connected to one another on other platforms like 
  Facebook providing both parties have their profile connected to the same social network.
- Published authors will receive priority over other writers when it comes to support.
    - Will likely give Unpublished Authors their own section to play in, outside the main app 
      section.
        - Unpublished Authors that emerge to the top of the lists can have the potential to get on 
          the field and off the 'sidelines'. I.e. They can join the world of Published Authored.
          - This would be a consensus amongst an existing
